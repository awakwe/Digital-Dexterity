## Course Description

This course offers an introduction to structured programming and algorithms using an object-oriented language. Topics covered include input/output, flow of control, functions, and a foundational overview of software engineering. Programming assignments are an integral part of the course.

Rationale

The course aims to equip students with fundamental programming skills using the C++ language. It serves as a stepping stone for learning more advanced aspects of C++ and other programming languages. The course emphasizes problem-solving techniques and design methodologies alongside language-specific skills.

Course Assignments

- **Textbook Readings and Lecture Presentations**: Essential for understanding course material.
  
Course Requirements

- **Discussions**: Students are required to participate in discussions, responding to prompts with at least 300-word threads and replying to at least two classmates with a minimum of 250 words. Citations in current APA format are required.
  
- **Programming Assignments**: Eight assignments using Visual Studio Express 2017 are designed to demonstrate mastery of the lessons learned. The complexity of assignments will increase progressively.
  
- **Quizzes**: Four quizzes will be administered, covering material from the current and preceding weeks. Quizzes are open-book/open-notes and consist of up to 75 multiple-choice and true/false questions with a 2-hour time limit.

---

## Arrays

- **Uniform Data Type**: All array components are of the same type.
- **Parameter Passing**: Arrays are usually passed by reference.
- **C-strings**: Special case where aggregate operations are allowed.
- **Initialization**: `int alpha[25];` 俱뫮잺 Array of 25 int components.
- **Loop Sum**: Loops can be used to sum array elements, but be cautious of index bounds.

---

## Structs

- **Member Access**: Use dot operator (.) to access struct members.
- **Initialization**: `rectangleData bigRect; bigRect.length = 10;`
- **Aggregate Operations**: Assignment is allowed; I/O operations are not.
- **Function Return**: Can return a struct.
- **Nested Structs**: Structs can contain other structs, e.g., `applianceList[25];`
- **Loop Initialization**: `for(int j = 0; j < 25; j++) applianceList.cost[j] = 0;`

---

## Functions

- **Return Types**: Functions can return structs.
- **Parameter Types**: Structs and arrays can be passed as parameters.

---

## Miscellaneous

- **Member Access**: Use the dot operator for struct member access.
- **Aggregate Operations**: Allowed for assignment in structs, not for I/O.
- **Value Updates**: Be cautious; e.g., `list[12] = list[5] + list[7];` may not update as expected.
